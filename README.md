Project Name: Work Day Scheduler

Description: The work day scheduler is a simple calendar application that allows the user to add events for each work hour (9AM-5PM) of the day. When the user opens the scheduler on the browser, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. 
Then, below is the main section of the app where there are timeblocks for standard business hours that are each color-coded to indicate past, present, or future. Past is colored grey, present is colored red, and future is colored green. 
Also, the user can save the events if they press the 'save button', which will have the events persist even when the user refreshes the page.

Limitations: need to manually delete the events for a new day.
